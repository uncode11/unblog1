                    <p>Angular JS is framework manage by Google, it help
                        build responsive sites. Angular JS use to make a smooth
                        web performance. Angular JS is a toolset for building the
                        framework most suited to your application development.
                        It is fully extensible and works well with other libraries.
                        Every feature can be modified or replaced to suit your
                        unique development workflow and feature needs.
                        Angular JS is a JavaScript framework. It can be added
                        to an HTML page with a script tag. Angular JS extends
                        HTML attributes with Directives, and binds data to
                        HTML with Expressions.
                        AngularJS extends HTML with new
                        attributes.AngularJS is perfect for Single Page
                        Applications (SPAs).AngularJS is easy to learn. The idea
                        turned out very well, and the project is now officially
                        supported by Google
                        AngularJS is a structural framework for dynamic web
                        applications. It lets you use HTML as your template
                        language and lets you extend HTML's syntax to express
                        your application components clearly and succinctly. Its
                        data binding and dependency injection eliminate much of
                        the code you currently have to write. And it all happens
                        within the browser, making it an ideal partner with any
                        server technology. It was originally developed by Misko
                        Hevery and Adam Abrons.
                        HTML is great for declaring static documents, but it
                        falters when we try to use it for declaring dynamic views in
                        web-applications. AngularJS lets you extend HTML
                        vocabulary for your application. The resulting
                        environment is e</p>

                    <p>AngularJS also known as Angular 1 is a framework for developing single page web applications.
                        WebStorm suggests AngularJS-aware completion options for predefined and custom ng directives and
                        for controller and application names, as well as code insights for data bindings inside
                        curly-brace expressions {{}}. You can use built-in AngularJS live templates and navigate between
                        the name of a controller in HTML and its definition in JavaScript or between ngView or
                        &routeProvider and the template.</p>

                    <h3>IMPORTANT PARTS OF ANGULARJS
                    </h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Data-binding:-It is the automatic synchronization of
                            data between model and view components. 
                            </li>
                        <li> Scope:-These are objects that refer to the model. They
                            act as a glue between controller and view.
                        </li>
                        <li> Controller:-These are JavaScript functions bound to a
                            particular scope.
                        </li>
                        <li>  Services:-AngularJS comes with several built-in
                            services such as $http to make a XMLHttpRequests.
                            These are singleton objects which are instantiated only
                            once in app.
                        </li>
                        <li>  Filters:-These select a subset of items from an array and
                            returns a new array.
                        </li>
                        <li>  Directives:-Directives are markers on DOM elements
                            such as elements, attributes, css, and more. These can
                            be used to create custom HTML tags that serve as new,
                            custom widgets. AngularJS has built-in directives such
                            as ngBind, ngModel etc.
                        </li>
                        <li>  Templates:-These are the rendered view with
                            information from the controller and model. These can
                            be a single file (such as index.html) or multiple views in
                            one page using partials.</li>
                        <li>Routing:-It is concept of switching views. </li>
                        <li>Model View Whatever:-MVW is a design pattern
                            for dividing an application into different parts called
                            Model, View, and Controller, each with distinct
                            responsibilities. AngularJS does not implement MVC in A module provides support for JavaScript, CSS3
                            transition and CSS3 keyframe animation hooks within
                            existing core and custom directives.
                            Since ng-* attributes are not valid in HTML
                            specifications, data-ng-* can also be used as a prefix.
                            For example, b</li>
                        
                    </ul>

                    <p>AngularJS can do everything that jQuery does and much
                        more, yet is roughly equivalent in download size. It is easy
                        to both write and run unit tests and end-to-end tests for
                        AngularJS applications. Dependency management is
                        effortless and intuitive. Binding dynamic data to your
                        views is straightforward and powerful. directives,
                        routing, services, validation, resources, animation and
                        localization - are equally thought out and useful
                        tools. AngularJS is a solid foundation for building testable
                        web applications that scale</p>
