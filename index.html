            <h2>What Is Front End Development?</h2>
            <p style="text-align: justify">Front end development is that part of software development that is visible
              to
              the users, i.e. the User
              Interface (UI) with which the users can interact. It transforms the complicated backend portion to an
              understandable user’s perspective through graphical ways. It aims at achieving a perfect user interface,
              speed, performance, and availability.

              Going by the mobile-first approach and responsive web design (RWD) are ideal ways to embed design
              components to the frontend for various screen sizes. Front end web developers seek expertise over HTML,
              CSS, and JavaScript to strengthen their foundation towards frontend development.

              Also known as client-side developers, frontend developers garner expertise in HTML, CSS, and JS for the
              creation of websites and apps. These technologies for front-end development make the base platform for
              page rendering and frontend engineering. Apart from these three, the frontend family includes a variety
              of
              libraries and dialects. It includes visual elements like a landing page, buttons, forms, menus,
              aesthetics, etc.</p>

          <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-4 col-sm-12 col-12 ">

            <h2>Web Development</h2>
            <p style="text-align: justify">The website’s front end is everything you see and can interact with using a
              browser. So, creating this
              visual part is called front-end development. You could even say that designers creating user interfaces
              and planning experiences are also front-end developers, as they are working in collaboration on the same
              part of the project.

              To create the front end, engineers use the combination of HTML (for basic page structure and content),
              CSS
              (for visual editing), and JavaScript (for making websites interactive). The same set of tools is used to
              create progressive web apps – mobile apps that look and feel like a native one but are created with the
              use of front-end technologies. There’s more about that in the linked article.</p>

            <h2>Front-end Vs. Back-end development</h2>
            <p style="text-align: justify">Web Development is primarily categorized into Front-end development and
              Back-end development. So, if you plan to start a career in web development, you should know what both
              terms mean.

              Front-end developers work on what the client can see while back-end developers fabricate the
              infrastructure that upholds it. The term "front-end" refers to the UI, while "back-end" signifies the
              server, application, and database working in the background to send the data to the client.

              The front-end is created using a blend of technologies, for example, Hypertext Markup Language (HTML),
              JavaScript, and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). Front-end developers design and create the user experience
              components on the website page or application, including dropdowns, buttons, menus, pages, connections,
              procedures, etc.

              The back-end, also called the server-side, comprises the server that delivers information on request,
              the
              application that channels it, and the database that arranges the data.

              There’s another term called Full-stack development, which is nothing but the combination of both
              front-end
              development and back-end development. </p>

                developing
                single-page, mobile, or server-side applications. It allows code to be debugged more efficiently by

                the MEAN
                stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, And Node.js). It is mostly used for developing single-page web
                applications
                (SPAs). Since it’s a flexible framework, developers can create progressive web apps or integrate the
                framework
                with technologies such as Ionic, Cordova, or NativeScripy to design near-native mobile applications.

                The tool has inbuilt templates that make it easy for developers to build UI views quickly. AngularJS
                provides
                simple, fast data binding without developer intervention. By supporting caching, it reduces the CPU’s
                workload.
                It provides fast loading and less navigation, ensuring an effective user experience. Gmail, Forbes,
                Upwork,

                interactive
                UIs (User Interfaces) (UIs) and SPAs (Single-page applications). Vue.js is one of the best JavaScript

                for creating a lightweight and adaptable interactive UI elements. The MVVM model (Model View-View Model)
                architecture pattern and its lightweight nature make Vue.js extremely easy to implement.

                HTML and CSS knowledge is required to use Vue.js. Also, Vue.js has a core library focused solely on the

              <p class="card-text">NPM, which stands for Node Package Manager, is a package manager completely written
                in javascript,
                and maintained by NPM, Inc. This is the default package manager for Node.js, which is the JavaScript
                runtime
                environment. The tool allows Node.js developers to discover, install, and develop Node programs, as well
                as
                discover reusable packages of code and reassemble them according to their priorities. It is considered
                to be the
                largest software registry in the world. npm is a command-line tool used to install, update, and
                uninstall
                Node.js packages and modules in an application.

                Over 350,000 packages make npm an essential front-end tool for JavaScript developers looking to share
                their code
                and reuse that of other developers. A few of the giants that use this platform for their
                applications/websites

              <p class="card-text">HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create the structure and content of web pages. It consists of various elements, each represented by tags, which describe the content's purpose and how it should be displayed in a web browser. HTML documents are the building blocks of websites and are
                 interpreted by web browsers to render the visual representation of the web page.HTML5 Boilerplate is a leading front-end template for designing fast, robust, and
                adaptable web
                apps and websites with HTML5-ready features and elements. You can access a mobile-friendly HTML
                template, a

                additional
                tips. There is a new HTML5-ready alternative to CSS resets called Normalize.css, and a suite of base

        <h1>what is full stack development?</h1>
        <p>Full-stack development refers to the practice of working on both the front-end and  
          back-end aspects of a web application or software system. A full-stack developer is a
           professional who is proficient in handling both the client-side (front-end) and 
           server-side (back-end) development tasks.

         </p>
        <br><br><br><br>
        <h2>Full-stack development offers several key benefits, making it a valuable 
          skill set in the world of web development. Here are some of the main advantages:</h2>
        <ul id="list">
          <li>Versatility: Full-stack developers have the ability to work on both the front-end and back-end of a web application. This versatility allows them to 
            handle a wider range of tasks and take on end-to-end responsibilities in the development process.</li>
          <li>Independence: Full-stack developers can work on projects independently, especially for smaller-scale applications or startups. They can handle the
             entire development process, reducing the need for multiple specialized developers.</li>
          <li>Faster Development: With knowledge of both front-end and back-end technologies, full-stack developers can streamline the development process. They can easily switch between tasks, collaborate with different team members, and understand the
             entire application architecture, leading to faster delivery of the final product.</li>
          <li>Better Communication: Full-stack developers can bridge the communication gap between front-end and back-end teams. Their understanding of both sides of development allows them to communicate effectively with
             specialists in each area, leading to smoother collaboration and reduced misunderstandings.</li>
          <li>Cost-Effective: For smaller projects or startups, hiring a full-stack developer can be more cost-effective than assembling a team of specialized developers.
             A single developer can handle multiple tasks, reducing the need for additional resources.</li>
          <li>Prototyping and MVPs: Full-stack developers are well-suited for rapid prototyping and building minimum viable products (MVPs). 
            They can quickly create functional prototypes, test ideas, and gather user feedback to iterate on the product.</li>
          <li>Easier Project Maintenance: Having a full-stack developer involved in the project from the beginning can make it easier to maintain and update the application over time. They understand the entire 
            codebase and can make informed decisions when implementing new features or fixing issues.</li>
          <li>Adaptability to Technologies: The tech landscape is continuously evolving. Full-stack developers can adapt more easily to new technologies and frameworks, 
            as they have a foundation in multiple areas. This adaptability is essential in a fast-paced industry.</li>
