                    <p>Bootstrap is a free and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end
                        web development. It contains HTML, CSS and (optionally) JavaScript-based design templates for
                        typography, forms, buttons, navigation, and other interface components.</p>

<!-- muhammadunaisak -->
                    <p>Bootstrap is an HTML, CSS and JS library that focuses on simplifying the development of
                        informative web pages (as opposed to web applications). The primary purpose of adding it to a
                        web project is to apply Bootstrap's choices of color, size, font and layout to that project. As
                        such, the primary factor is whether the developers in charge find those choices to their liking.
                        Once added to a project, Bootstrap provides basic style definitions for all HTML elements. The
                        result is a uniform appearance for prose, tables and form elements across web browsers. In
                        addition, developers can take advantage of CSS classes defined in Bootstrap to further customize
                        the appearance of their contents. For example, Bootstrap has provisioned for light- and
                        dark-colored tables, page headings, more prominent pull quotes, and text with a highlight.</p>
                    <br>
                    <!-- muhammadunaisak -->
                    <p>They provide additional user interface elements such as dialog boxes, tooltips, progress bars,
                        navigation drop-downs, and carousels. Each Bootstrap component consists of an HTML structure,
                        CSS declarations, and in some cases accompanying JavaScript code. They also extend the
                        functionality of some existing interface elements, including for example an auto-complete
                        function for input fields.</p>
                    <p>A precompiled version of Bootstrap is available in the form of one CSS file and three JavaScript
                        files that can be readily added to any project. The raw form of Bootstrap, however, enables
                        developers to implement further customization and size optimizations. This raw form is modular,
                        meaning that the developer can remove unneeded components, apply a theme and modify the
                        uncompiled Sass files.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Why Bootstrap?</h3>
                    <p>Bootstrap is the go-to toolkit for many front-end developers. According to W3Techs, it's used by
                        22.1% of all websites on the internet.

                        There are a few factors driving Bootstrap’s popularity. First and foremost, it’s open-source and
                        therefore free to download and use. It’s also fully customizable, and compatible with all modern
                        browsers. This is true of many CSS frameworks, however.

                        What sets Bootstrap apart from other development toolkits is that it was developed mobile-first.
                        Meaning, the code was optimized for mobile devices (i.e. the smallest screen size) first and
                        then scaled up to display on larger screens. As a result, building with Bootstrap CSS ensures
                        that your site supports proper rendering and touch zooming for all devices.

                        Another reason Bootstrap is so popular is that it’s easy to use. It comes bundled with templates
                        for typography, forms, buttons, drop-down menus, navigation, and other interface components.
                        Using these pre-styled templates, you can add features that enrich the user experience on your
                        site without having to code them from scratch.</p>


                    <h3>When to Use Bootstrap</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>You want a responsive website.</li>
                        <p>Building a responsive site is much easier using Bootstrap than doing so from scratch.
                            Bootstrap comes with responsive styles, like containers and media queries, to ensure your
                            site adjusts to the viewport. That means you don’t have to worry about whether your visitors
                            are using desktops, tablets, or mobile devices. </p>
                        <li>You want to save time. </li>
                        <p>You can build your site quickly with Bootstrap. Once you download the framework, you can get
                            started with a basic template and then add the components you need. These components are
                            fundamental HTML elements, like tables, forms, buttons, images, and icons, that are styled
                            with a base class and extended with modifier classes. Using these pre-designed components
                            significantly limits the amount of custom CSS you have to write.</p>
                        <li>You’re familiar with HTML and CSS.</li>
                        <p>Though Bootstrap does simplify the process of building a site, you’ll have to be familiar
                            with HTML and CSS to use the framework. For example, understanding the CSS box model will be
                            important when using the container class and building your first Bootstrap grid.

                            The good news is you’ll only need a basic knowledge of coding to get started. </p>
                        <li>You have multiple people building out your site.</li>
                        <p>If you have multiple collaborators working on a site, then consistency is important. You
                            don’t want buttons on your homepage to look different from buttons on your landing page, or
                            to use a different website typography on your blog than anywhere else on your site — and so
                            on. Using Bootstrap and its default settings, utility classes, and component elements can
                            help ensure the front end of your site looks consistent.</p>
                        <li>You want to be part of a community.</li>
                        <p>Since Bootstrap is open source, it has a global community of developers and designers
                            dedicated to supporting the framework. These developers and designers modify and enhance
                            Bootstrap's codebase on GitHub. They also answer questions on Twitter, Stack Overflow, and
                            in a dedicated Slack room. When using Bootstrap, you can leverage this active community to
                            become a better Bootstrap user.</p>

                    </ul>
                    <h3>Building Your Responsive Site</h3>
                    <p>Bootstrap is a powerful front-end framework for building and customizing a mobile-friendly site.
                        With Bootstrap, you don’t have to start from scratch or give up control over the appearance of
                        your site. Get started exploring this framework now to see just how much it’s capable of.</p>
