                    <p>React is a JavaScript library for creating user interfaces, open
                        sourced to the world by Facebook and Instagram team in 2013. One might think of it as the “View”
                        in the “Model-View-Controller” pattern.</p>
                </article>

                <article class="blog-post">



                    <p> React has lately gained a lot of popularity for its concept of a “virtual-DOM,” which allows it
                        to determine which parts of the DOM have changed by diffing the new version with the stored
                        virtual DOM, and using the result to determine how to most efficiently update the browser's DOM.React was created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Facebook, with the influence of XHP, a
                        PHP-based component system that is still in use at Facebook, but also by functional programming
                        ideas. Pete Hunt wanted to use React at Instagram, so he pushed to extract React from
                        Facebook-specific code and open source it. (Editor's note: Some have expressed concern about the
                        React license; see discussions here, here, and most recently (Jan2016) here, with discussion of
                        some alternatives here. We're not lawyers but figure it's important to be aware of this sort of
                        thing.)

                    <h5>React’s popularity today has eclipsed that of all other front-end development frameworks. Here
                        is why:</h5>
                    <ul>
                        
                        <li>Unidirectional data flow: React follows a unidirectional data flow. This means that when
                            designing a React app, developers often nest child components within parent components.
                            Since the data flows in a single direction, it becomes easier to debug errors and know where
                            a problem occurs in an application at the moment in question.</li>
                        <li>Small learning curve: React is easy to learn, as it mostly combines basic HTML and
                            JavaScript concepts with some beneficial additions. Still, as is the case with other tools
                            and frameworks, you have to spend some time to get a proper understanding of React’s
                            library.</li>
                            <li>Easy creation of dynamic applications: React makes it easier to create dynamic web
                                applications because it requires less coding and offers more functionality, as opposed to
                                JavaScript, where coding often gets complex very quickly.</li>
                            <li>Improved performance: React uses Virtual DOM, thereby creating web applications faster.
                                Virtual DOM compares the components’ previous states and updates only the items in the Real
                                DOM that were changed, instead of updating all of the components again, as conventional web
                                applications do. </li>
                            <li>Reusable components: Components are the building blocks of any React application, and a
                                single app usually consists of multiple components. These components have their logic and
                                controls, and they can be reused throughout the application, which in turn dramatically
                                reduces the application’s development time.</li>
                        <li>It can be used for the development of both web and mobile apps: We already know that React
                            is used for the development of web applications, but that’s not all it can do. There is a
                            framework called React Native, derived from React itself, that is hugely popular and is used
                            for creating beautiful mobile applications. So, in reality, React can be used for making
                            both web and mobile applications.</li>
                        <li>Dedicated tools for easy debugging: Facebook has released a Chrome extension that can be
                            used to debug React applications. This makes the process of debugging React web applications
                            faster and easier.</li>
                    </ul>
